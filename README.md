## About me!
I'm a fullstack developer. I also respect open source development, but it isn't my priority (if you think something else, let's talk about it).

### JS
JS (i prefer to say instead of JavaScript) is my biggest favorite in my career. An language with capality of using in both frontend and backend, mobile app development and so anything else. There is a rational syntax, complex paridigm and flexibilty in JS which can encourage you to go deep on it. do you want to know how much time do you need to learn JS completely? heh, you should know how you can be immortal fisrt. but after watching some course in youtube which made by indian guys, you can go deeper by reading [You don't know JS yet](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) books series written by [getify](https://github.com/getify).

### ubutnu
Who can live without ubuntu? show me!
After going around linux distribution world finally i can't see anything better than ubuntu (you should know i also try fedora). its package manager `apt` and `snap` are very fast and complete. it have a big commuinity around world and it is very stable. you can hear more than this just by using [Google](https://www.google.com)!

### education
I now studing computer engineering(you may know him computer sicence) at sharif university of technology which is a famous university in my country and has top rank in universities of IRI(Islamic Republic of Iran). Until now, i love DS (Data Structure and Algorithms) and programming course like fundamentals of programming, Advanced programming and mobile app programming. I know there is lots of thing to learn in university, so let's go on!

### last and important
At last with much proud i should say, iâ€™m a muslim iranian.

## Favorite
### teaching
I Like teaching a lot. Generally, i like to help anyone who can i do. specially i sometime teach mathematics to someone in highscool. but if you think i have knowledge about something, i would be really happy if you invite me for teaching it to someone.

## Ablities
After all, i should say i code with Java, C, C++ which are shown in my projects (don't forget to star them). i learnt them in [university](https://www.sharif.ir).
