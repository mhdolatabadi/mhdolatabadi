## About me!
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Bio
I'm MohammadHossein Dolatabadi, computer engineering student at Sharif University of Technology. I'm a fullstack developer. I also respect open source development, but it isn't my priority (if you think something else, let's talk about it).

### [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilbarbara/logos/master/logos/javascript.svg" alt="JavaScript" width="25" align="center"/>](https://github.com/mhdolatabadi/mhdolatabadi) JavaScript
Let start with a sentece from Kyle Simpson: <br />
> When developers encounter confusion, they usually blame the language(JavaScript) instead of their lack of understanding.

JS (I prefer to say instead of JavaScript üòé), the language which created in only 10 days but conquer the üåè, is a language with capability of using in both frontend and backend, mobile app development and so anything else. There is a rational syntax, complex paradigm and flexibility in JS which can encourage you to go deep on it. Do you want to know how much time you need to learn JS completely? hah, you should know how you can be immortal first. After 6 month experience with JS (as getify says), you can go deeper by reading [You don't know JS yet](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) books series written by [getify](https://github.com/getify). before that? just start and search.

I want to start with a sentence from Linus Torvalds:
> A computer is like air conditioning, it becomes useless if you open windows.

If you get familiar with Linux you can't stay programmer without it. Using command line and many tools which linux provides helps you to do programming easier. Even if you use linux instead of window i promise you will be younger in long time ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I sometimes try windows to see if it has changed or not, but it was as worse as then. <br/>

Life is shorter than waste it on debate about which distribution is better but after try some Linux distributions, finally, i chose Ubuntu. Its package manager `apt` and `snap` are adequate. It has a big community so you can find your problems and questions soon (for exmaple see [ask ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com)). You can find out more, just by using [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilbarbara/logos/master/logos/google.svg" alt="JavaScript" width="55" align="center"/>](https://www.google.com)!


### üë®‚Äçüéì Education
I am now studying computer engineering(you may know computer science but there are some deferences between them) at Sharif University of Technology which is a famous and university in Iran and top ranked in glob. Until now, I loved DS (Data Structure and Algorithms) and programming courses like Fundamentals of Programming, Advanced Programming and Mobile App Programming(which contains android, ios and flutter learning) and hardware courses like Computer Architecture. I know there are lots of things to learn in university, so let's go on!

### ü§ù Contribution
I am always open to contributing in open source projects around github, but i never try it. After that if you think i can resolve issues in any project just [contact](m.h.dolatabadi.a@gmail.com) me! now i prefer contributing in development of mobile applications. recently, i looking for a project and i'm going to select one in near future.

###### ‚§µÔ∏è PRs(Pull Requests)
If you like one of my projects and you think you can improve it, I am always open to pull requests. so let try contribute in my projects to learn much more from each other.

### üë®‚Äçüè´ teaching
I Like teaching a lot. Generally, I like to help anyone who needs it. I sometimes teach mathematics to someone in high school. but if you think I have knowledge about something, I would be really happy if you invite me to teach it to someone.

## üí™ Ablities
After all, I should say I code with
