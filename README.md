## About me!
I'm a fullstack developer. I also respect open source development, but it isn't my priority (if you think something else, let's talk about it).

### JS
JS (i prefer to say instead of JavaScript) is my biggest favorite in my career. A language with capability of using in both frontend and backend, mobile app development and so anything else. There is a rational syntax, complex paradigm and flexibility in JS which can encourage you to go deep on it. Do you want to know how much time you need to learn JS completely? heh, you should know how you can be immortal first. but after watching some course in youtube which made by indian guys, you can go deeper by reading [You don't know JS yet](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) books series written by [getify](https://github.com/getify).

### ubutnu
Who can live without ubuntu? show me!
After going around the Linux distribution world finally I can't see anything better than ubuntu (you should know i also try fedora). its package manager `apt` and `snap` are very fast and complete. It has a big community around the world and it is very stable. you can hear more than this just by using [Google](https://www.google.com)!


### education
I am now studying computer engineering(you may know him computer science) at sharif university of technology which is a famous university in my country and has top rank in universities of IRI(Islamic Republic of Iran). Until now, I loved DS (Data Structure and Algorithms) and programming courses like fundamentals of programming, Advanced programming and mobile app programming. I know there are lots of things to learn in university, so let's go on!

### last and important
At last with much proud i should say, iâ€™m a muslim iranian.

## Favorite
### teaching
I Like teaching a lot. Generally, I like to help anyone who needs it. I sometimes teach mathematics to someone in high school. but if you think I have knowledge about something, I would be really happy if you invite me to teach it to someone.

### contribution
I am always open to contributing in open source projects around github, but i never try it. After that if you think i can resolve issues in any project just [contact](m.h.dolatabadi.a@gmail.com) me! now i prefer contributing in development of mobile applications. recently, i looking for a project and i'm going to select one in near future.

#### PRs(Pull Requests)
If you like one of my projects and you think you can improve it, I am always open to pull requests. so let try contribute in my projects to learn much more from each other.

## Ablities
After all, I should say I code with Java, C, C++ which are shown in my projects (don't forget to star them). i learnt them in [university](https://www.sharif.ir).
